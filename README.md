# Selenium Web Scraping Project

A beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates web automation and web scraping using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**. Inspired by the [“Selenium Tutorial for Beginners using Python | Selenium for Web Scraping (With Project)” video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XI5_nsClCYI), this project extracts key data from product pages and structures it in a CSV file.

---

##  Project Overview

- Automates browser navigation using **Selenium**.
- Parses page content with **BeautifulSoup**.
- Extracts product **titles**, **prices**, and **links** from saved HTML or live pages.
- Stores the results in a `data.csv` file using **pandas**.

---

##  Why This Project Matters

- Demonstrates hands-on experience with **web automation** and **dynamic content handling**.
- Aligns directly with Knovos’s internship requirements, including:
  - Python and OOP concepts
  - Selenium or automation tool exposure
  - Data extraction, parsing, and handling
- Showcases your ability to **learn proactively** and build real-world solutions—even with limited UI.
